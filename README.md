# Tsukuyo

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

## About

This project is basically an anime discover app, it has local storage, search functionality, and various things (maybe i'll make it something like a MAL clone)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5175/](http://localhost:5175/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
